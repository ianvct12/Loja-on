== Description ==

Create, manage and track QR Codes in WordPress with Qyrr.

Use the power of the QR Code editor to create a fully customizable QR Code without any Third-Party-APIs.

== Features ==

**Sources**

Create a QR Code for all your posts and pages or use an external URL.
We also support various other sources (texts, WhatsApp and SMS messages, E-Mails, Phone numbers, vCards) within Qyrr Pro.

**Embed QR Codes**

Easily embed QR codes into your website. Use the custom block or the integrated shortcode.

Forget about copying IDs into clunky shortcodes, we handle that automatically for you.
The only thing you have to do is copy and paste the QR Code or select the code within the block.

**Style your QR Code**

Qyrr offers an entire toolkit for styling your QR Code.

Adjust the size, background color, fill color, the minimum readable version, the quiet zone, add rounded corners and improve the error handling level for better results.

**Add your logo**

Qyrr enables you to add your own logo inside of the QR Code. Want to use some custom text instead? Qyrr can handle that too.

Adjust the size and position of the logo and use Google Fonts to match text on your QR Code with your website design.

**Download QR Codes**

You can easily download your QR code from the QR Code editor. Choose a format (PNG within the free version, SVG and PNG within Qyrr Pro).

**Manage QR Code campains**

Easily manage your QR Codes with campaigns.

Having an event coming up and you want to quickly see all QR Codes related to it? Create a campaign and assign your QR Codes to it.

Once done you can easily filter all your QR Codes for a specific campaign.

== Qyrr Pro ==

**Sources**

In addition to external URLs and posts/pages Qyrr Pro offers:

- Texts
- WhatsApp
- SMS
- E-Mails
- Phone numbers
- vCards
- Support for custom post types (like products in WooCommerce)

**Dynamic QR Codes**

With Qyrr Pro you can create dynamic QR Codes.

A dynamic QR Code never needs to be re-printed. You can easily change the target of the QR Code without changing the QR Code itself.

**Difference between static QR Codes and dynamic QR Codes**

Static QR Code

- the source cannot be modified
- you can't track the usage of a static QR Code

Dynamic QR Code

- the embedded information can be changed anytime+
- you can easily track the QR code usage in WordPress (without external tools)

**Bulk Generate QR Codes**

Qyrr Pro offers a powerful bulk generator for QR Codes.

Create a basic QR Code that you use as a template and bulk generated hundreds or thousands of QR Codes based on that template.

We offer an CSV-based import where you can simply copy and paste a list of URLs that we use to generate the individual QR Codes.

We also offer a dynamic ID solution where you link to the exact same page/URL, but because of the ID you can track each QR Code individually.

**Track QR Code usage**

Easily track the usage of your QR Code within Qyrr Pro.

Each time a dynamic QR Code is scanned, we increase the usage value in the QR Codes overview accordingly.

Combined with the integration campaigns, you can immediately evaluate the effectiveness of your QR Code campaign.

**Export as SVG**

Qyrr Pro offers the ability to export your QR Codes as an SVG file (vector file).

It's often required to provide an vector file if you want to print your QR code professionally, because of that Qyrr Pro offers an unlimited scalable vector file as an export.
